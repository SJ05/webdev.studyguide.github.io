# Introduction to Web Development
This is just a short introduction about web development. It's based on my own understanding. There are lots of resources that you can check upon and for sure this will be constantly udpated as I grow as a web developer.

## What is **Web Development**?
For me, it refers to a process of building, creating and maintaining a website or a piece of application for the internet or intranet.

## Basic Concepts

- **Server Side** is where we put a bunch of files to be stored in a computer. It’s what we call a server.
- The other term of server side is **Back-End** which deals with what you cannot see in the browser. It handles a lot of the logic and functionalities being done in your website.
- **Client Side** – loads the data from the server. Example of which is our browsers such as Google Chrome, Edge and Mozilla.
- The other term of client side is **Front-End** which deals with what you see in the browser. It handles the visual presentation and viewing behavior of your website.

## Basic Front-end Development

The basic building blocks of a front-end development are the **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. These are the things that are being loaded in the browser.
- **HTML** – Hyper Text MarkUp Language is basically the foundation of all website. This is where it started. It contains all the contents of a particular page on the website. And we utilize tags to indicate that this text is a title, a paragraph, a list or this section is dedicated for an image. Just like our word document
- **CSS**  - Cascading Style Sheets is the file that let’s us design and put layout in our website to make it more presentable. It let’s us add colors, change the width and height of an element in the HTML and a lot more.
- **JavaScript** – is a programming language that runs in the browser it let’s us manage the things going on within the website. For example, we have a button, what will our website do if we click that one. So basically, we create a function for it then decide what happens, will it move to the next screen will it change the color of a text in the page?
- When we say **Frameworks**, these are packages containing pre-written standardized codes of files and folders to better organized our development flow. There are several frameworks that we could used nowadays. The popular ones are the Angular, React, Vue, Jquery and a lot more. You may check them out see what framework are you able to put an expertise on. 

## Basic Back-end Development

The three components for back-end development are the Servers, the Database and the Server-Side programming language.
- **Server** – as we mentioned a while ago the server contains all the components that you need to run for your website in a single place. In a traditional setting it runs on two operating systems, and they are Linux and Windows. In today’s age, we have Serverless services that are available in the market. When we say serverless meaning this kind of services enables us to build and run applications without having to manage the infrastructure itself. There are popular services that are available, example of which are AWS, Azure, IBM Cloud and Google Cloud. 
- **Language** – the programing language that we use to write the logic or functions needed for our application. It’s responsible for analyzing what the user has given in the client-side. In connection to the server, what the server does is to run and compile those codes that you created using a particular language and then once the data has been evaluated, the results will just go back to the client-end side.
- **Database** – it’s where we store our data, the information that we have. Often, we deal with SQL, pronounced as Sequel. It is short for Structured Query Language. It has tables where you do the creation, retrieval, update and deletion of the data that you want to manipulate. Popular relational database is MySql and the Microsoft SQL Server. We also have the NoSQL where instead of tables we have JSON files. JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation. Instead of tables we have this JSON structure that has parameters and values with it. One example of a NoSQL is MongoDB. Basically, when we say database, it is like a storage box where we put the data information that we have for our users and the application itself.
- There are a lot of back-end frameworks that you can check with regards to back-end development. For example, ASP.NET utilized C# programming language while Spring boot has Java as it’s language. You may check out the ones depending on your interest or the requirement of your application.

- **Code Editors** are the text editors to edit your source code. 
- Well **Package Managers** is a system that manages your project dependencies. When we say dependencies, we are referring to third-party software that were written by someone else and then you needed that piece of software, so that you don’t have to code everything from scratch. Basically, it’s like a plug-in for your project. The beauty of these package managers is they make things easier for you. You don’t have to manually look for the libraries that you need, you don’t have to download and put them one by one in their correct locations and you don’t have to remove the unnecessary files since it is conveniently manage by them. In the simplest analogy, think of it as you have a package that you wanted to deliver. The package manager is responsible in getting the necessary information and the one who checks where to get the materials that you wanted to to have. We have two example here which is NPM and Yarn.
- **Build Tools** on a basic level they run tasks and compiles our files. They bundle our files and help turn our development codes into a production-ready code that runs on any device or platform without a problem. If the package manager is the one who gets the things that you need, the build tool is the one who is responsible to bundle your packages that is ready for delivery. So that once you deliver the materials are complete.
- **Version Control** is also called as “source control”, they track and manages the changes in your source code. For example, you created a code but then there was an error, with this version control, you can revert your source code into their original or working state. It’s like in a game you have an infinite save points that whenever you did something you can always go back and check what more you can do.

## Full Stack Development

When we say Full Stack Development it is the combination of having the capability to do the front-end and back-end. I’m going to present the TOP 3 popular technology stack that you may encounter once you are in the industry.

- **MEAN** – is an acronym for MongoDB, Express.js, Angular and Node.js
- **MERN** – is an acronym for MongoDB, Express.js, React and Node.js
- **MEVN** – is an acronym for MongoDB, Express.js, Vue and Node.js

These are combination of the tools being used for the creating websites and applications. The only difference between these stacks is how they are structured and how fast you can develop when using them. It might depend on your interest and the requirements of your application. It's highly recommended to at least know one tech stack.
